NOTES:

graphQL is a query language. Meaning it works almost kind of like SQL. Where we can call on a thing and get only that thing back, just within the call itself


graphQL query is communicating to a route like a get method (querying the data) 
graphQL mutation is like a put, post, and delete method (mutating the data)
